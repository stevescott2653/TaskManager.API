# How to Run the Task Manager Application from the Command Line

## 1. Start the Backend API

Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the API project (where Program.cs is located):

dotnet run

The backend will start (by default on http://localhost:5077 or similar).

---

## 2. Start the Frontend (React Client)

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory:

cd taskmanager-client
npm install
npm run dev

The frontend will start (by default on http://localhost:5173).

## 3. Access the Application

Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5173

- **Login page:** http://localhost:5173/login
- **Register page:** http://localhost:5173/register

**Note:**  
- Make sure both the backend API and frontend client are running at the same time.
- Always run `dotnet run` in the API root directory, and `npm run dev` in the `taskmanager-client` directory.
